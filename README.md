AI-Powered Network Anomaly Detection
Overview
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Neural Networks for cybersecurity, focusing on network anomaly detection to identify cyber threats like zero-day exploits, APTs, and social engineering attacks.

Approach
Machine Learning Model: A neural network-based model trained on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, containing both normal and malicious network traffic.

Techniques Used:
Batch Normalization, Dropout Layers, and Early Stopping to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
User Behavior Analytics & Fraud Detection for detecting sophisticated cyber threats.

Performance
The model achieves 99.89% cross-validated accuracy in detecting network anomalies.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
Challenges include detecting rare attack types due to dataset imbalance.

Ethical Considerations
This project also explores ethical concerns regarding data protection, fairness, and responsible AI usage in cybersecurity.

Future Work
Improving detection of rare attack types through data balancing techniques.
Enhancing model robustness with real-world cybersecurity datasets.
